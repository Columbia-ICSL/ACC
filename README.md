# SPIDERS: Low-Cost Wireless Glasses for Continuous In-Situ Bio-Signal Acquisition and Emotion Recognition

We  present  a  System  for  Processing  In-situ  Bio-signal  Data  for  Emotion  Recognition  and  Sensing  (SPIDERS)–  a  low-cost,  wireless,  glasses-based  platform  for  continuous  in-situ  monitoring  of  user’s  facial  expressions  (apparent  emotions) and  real  emotions.  We  present  algorithms  to  provide  four  corefunctions   (eye   shape   and   eyebrow   movements,   pupillometry, zygomaticus  muscle  movements,  and  head  movements),  using the   bio-signals   acquired   from   three   non-contact   sensors   (IR camera, proximity sensor, IMU). SPIDERS distinguishes betweendifferent  classes  of  apparent  and  real  emotion  states  based  on the   aforementioned   four   bio-signals.   We   prototype   advanced functionalities   including   facial   expression   detection   and   realemotion classification with a facial expression detector based onlandmarks  and  optical  flow  that  leverages  changes  in  a  user’s eyebrows  and  eye  shapes  to  achieve  up  to 83.87% accuracy,  as well  as  a  pupillometry-based  real  emotion  classifier  with  higher accuracy than other low-cost wearable platforms that use sensors requiring skin contact. SPIDERS costs less than $20 to assemble and  can  continuously  run  for  up  to 9 hours  before  recharging. We  demonstrate  that  SPIDERS  is  a  truly  wireless  and  portable platform  that  has  the  capability  to  impact  a  wide  range  ofapplications,  where  knowledge  of  the  user’s  emotional  state  is critical.
